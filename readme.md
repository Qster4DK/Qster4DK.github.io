Used a tile array like in the given code. The board is also a 2d array.
The stats bar shows the current word, total score, remaining tiles, and the highscore.
The tiles are draggable and the board/rack are droppable, so the tiles can be placed onto those droppable slots.
Some features that are not implemented yet is a full 2d board, dictionary checking to make sure it is a real word, and a finish/end to the game.
The only thing from the rubric that is graded and missing is that the tile should bounce back when it is not connected to the word? The tile does not bounce back but the button does not let the user submit the word.
